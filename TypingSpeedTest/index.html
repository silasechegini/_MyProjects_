                    <p>
                        This is a simple project which will help a user improve on typing skills as much as possible, both speed wise and correctness wise. 
                        Although there is a lot of logic and aesthetics which can be added to this project to make it more attractive or interesting, 
                        this piece only handles the basic stuff. However, the project can still be given a face lift as things go by. <br>
                        Enjoy!

                <p>Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an oral tradition, and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. From the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three. But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.</p>
