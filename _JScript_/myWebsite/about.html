                <!-- Ngozi Silas E received B.Eng in Electronics and Communications Engineering from All Nations University and conferred by 
                the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi â€“ Ghana in November 2012, where he graduate with Honors. 
                After completing his B.Eng degree, Ngozi was offered a position as a Teaching assistant at All Nations University where 
                he worked with the Electronics and Communications Engineering department. He thought about 6 courses, supervised over 10 
                undergraduate projects as part of his duties within the department, and was also a mentor for a few science clubs on campus. 
                Ngozi has always understood the importance of industry and academic collaboration. This motivated him to take up a role with 
                Nigerian University Commission/TETFund as a mechatronics engineer/researcher , a role which he occupied for about 2 years. 
                As an engineer/researcher, Ngozi was directly involved in several projects to deliver training services on ground at over 73 
                Federal universities and polytechnics in Nigeria. These projects cut across areas like site facilitation, engineering equipment 
                installation and commissioning, among all others. Currently, has a Master of Applied Science (MASc)-on track with a PHd; and a 
                research assistant/Teaching assistant in the Systems and Computer Engineering Department at Carleton University, Ottawa, 
                Ontario - Canada. His current research focuses on providing efficient routing solutions for hierarchical MANETS, machine/deep 
                learning. Other research/professional interests are in the areas of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks, Planning and Design of computer 
                networks, Mobile computing, and Application Software Development. -->
